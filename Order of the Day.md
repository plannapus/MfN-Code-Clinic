* Classification algorithms (FM)
* Landmark analysis (FM and others)
* Follow-up on R phylogenies sessions from last spring: rewrite together a `read.nexus` function that can catch all variations of this format and be compatible with main phylogeny-based R packages such ape, paleotree, dispRity, Claddis, etc. (JR)
* Discussion on tips on how to write memory-efficient code (in R or other languages) (JR)
