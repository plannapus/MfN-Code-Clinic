30th Meeting - 30th of August 2017

Attendance: 6

We discussed about method to estimate missing values in order to be able to input the maximum number of specimens/variables in a PCA (for Antoine's mesosaurs). Inferring values based on single-bones models, or iterative imputation based on the PCA run (as in PaST; Ilin & Raiko 2010) were discussed. Error propagation in the PCA as a result was also discussed.
