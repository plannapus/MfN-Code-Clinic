Melanie introduced to us the R package [speciesgeocodeR](https://github.com/azizka/speciesgeocodeR).  
We discussed with Antoine of how to compare various PCA.  
I updated people on [my efforts](https://github.com/plannapus/MfN-Code-Clinic/blob/master/Scripts/2017/Code%202017-10-18%20-%20clamp.R) to come up with a new model for CLAMP. We discussed cross-validation a little as a result.
