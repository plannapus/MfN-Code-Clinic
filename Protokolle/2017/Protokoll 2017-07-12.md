27th Meeting - 12th of July 2017

Attendance: 4

We reviewed a script I wrote, trying to reproduce the results of Rojas et al 2017 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G38944.1). In this study the authors identify biogeographic provinces in albian ammonites using network analysis, and Infomap clustering. The data was given in supplementary material but not the code. We thus tried to reproduce the missing code based on the Method explanation of the paper. The results are (to a large extent) reproducible but we were not able to find out the reason behind some minor differences between their output and ours.

Next meeting, TBD.
