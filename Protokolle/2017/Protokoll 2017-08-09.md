29th Meeting - 9th of August 2017

Attendance: 5

As promised I gave a crash course on how PCA and other classic ordination methods are implemented in R. I also showed an example of the use of CCA by showing the paleobotanical/climatological concept of CLAMP analysis (and my new version of it). We also tried to apply all that to Antoine's mesosaur data.

Next meeting on the 23rd of August.
