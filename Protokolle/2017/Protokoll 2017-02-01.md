19th meeting - 1st of February 2017
----
Attendance: 6

Following Falko email, we discussed what we needed him to explain to us during next meeting.
We also discuss various Club-related issues: how to organize the club when I can't; what to do during meeting where people do not have issues to discuss (=> we'll review code, either from us or from literature; occasionally we might even write some code together).
Next meeting of February the 15th.
