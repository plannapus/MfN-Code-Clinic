4th meeting - 21 january 2016
-----

Attendance: 6

This meeting was spent debugging Melanie's code. First issue was with a new package doing bayesian analysis and using a just-in-time compiler, but throwing an error doing compiling, primarily because RStudio didn't find the path to Rtools and its compilers. Prior to this, on other machines, the package itself refused to compile. This sparked a conversation on package management and installation, but also on the need to limit the use of dependencies in packages to keep the code manageable over the years.

Second issue was with HTML parsing a species page from the IUCN red list. This case study needed a combination of xml parsing as seen during the 2nd meeting of the club and REGEX.

It was decided that, since the room was taken on February the 4th and then every two weeks after, the next meeting will be in 3 weeks instead of 2 in order to be able to book the room in alternance with the other occupants. Next meeting will therefore be on February the 11th.
