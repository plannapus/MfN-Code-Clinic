10th meeting - 4th May 2016

Attendance: 7

Sebastian explained his issue which was that he need to perform a specific operation in various files scattered across various folders. I showed how to use function "dir" i. e. dir(pattern="pattern.txt", recursive=TRUE) to search recursively throughout the folders which files followed a specific pattern. Then with the vector of file names, extract a specific pattern (here a species name) from them using functions strsplit and gsub. The occasion to introduce the concept of regular expressions.
We also naturally discuss about the alternative of dealing with all that information using a database instead of an arborescence of folders.

Next meeting the 19th.
