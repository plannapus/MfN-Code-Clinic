Brandon introduced package 'bayou' which fits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to phylogenetic data using Bayesian inference. He had several issues with it, including the fact that the branches numbers did not correspond to the order of elements of `edge` from the original 'ape'-style tree.

After this, I showed a work-in-progress of mine, a code written based on an idea of Clement, simulating phylogenies based on given speciation/extinction rates, to test if the fact that some ecologies (here specifically, habitats) having intrinsically different speciation rates, caused a bias on the reconstruction of the ancestral ecology. (Code attached). This was a pure review, with valuable feedbacks by the other attendants on the algorithm and on the biology behind the code. Package 'diversitree' was mentioned as a package allowing similar simulations and tests to be done.

Next meeting 23th of June.
