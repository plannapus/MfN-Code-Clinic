5th meeting - 11 february 2016
-----

Attendance: 5

Martin came with an issue dealing with ggplot2. The particular issue was with having two plots side by side sharing an y-axis (as one of them with a stratigraphic log and the other geochemical data in the corresponding section). 
As nobody present had enough experience with ggplot2, nobody was really able to help unfortunately: we navigated aimlessly inside the created ggplot object to find how to modify it, without result.
I briefly showed how to use function `layout` combined with `par` and basic `plot` arguments to produce the desired effect in base plot however. Though, since the whole workflow was already written in ggplot2, it was of little help.

Next meeting was scheduled for the 25th of February, with the hope that more people will attend it.
