Sebastian came up with a dataset of lizard weight measured every hour for several specimen and we wrote a function giving the relative per-hour weight loss of each specimen. In the process we discuss how to make a simple piece of code like this a bit more universal, how to catch user input error, how to discard anomalous specimens, how to add a default value for an argument and why, etc.
