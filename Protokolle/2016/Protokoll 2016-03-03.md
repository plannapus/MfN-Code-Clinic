7th meeting - 3rd march 2016
----

Attendance: 8

As promised I presented a short introduction to importing, creating, handling and exporting GIS files in R (with an emphasis on shapefiles, rasters and netCDF files). Script can be found at the end of this protokoll. Sebastian also showed an introduction to higher-level packages performing similar tasks, in particular package dismo that has the added advantage to be able to extract data directly from GBIF as well as maps directly from Google. This, incidentally, triggered a discussion on the legal implications of using such a package (as the GBIF site doesn't allow extracting data without agreeing to terms and conditions this package doesn't even mention).
Next meeting: 24th of March, with a discussion on knitr and Rmarkdown.
