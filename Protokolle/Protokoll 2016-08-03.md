13th meeting - 3rd August 2016
----
Attendance: 6

We went through the basics on how to write a function, how to see the source code of a function, how to use this knowledge to use optimally functions of tha apply family (with a special focus on how to perform a correlation between two variables splitted by categories).
We shortly discuss at the end the issue of the github account (public versus private).
We ended up with keeping the status quo of having a public repository while trying not to put any sensitive data.

Next meeting the 17th of this month.
