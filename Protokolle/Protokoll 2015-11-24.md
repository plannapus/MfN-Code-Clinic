1st meeting of the 'Code Clinic' programming club - 24 November 2015
----
Attendance: 11

1. Introductory remark by two of the initiators of the club, stating its primary purposes: providing help with programming (debugging, but also help with basic implementation, tips on specific aspect of programming) and brainstorming algorithms and more generally methodologies.

2. Presentation of attendants. 11 attendants with the following breakdowns:
	- Programming Language:
		R 		10 (inc. 5 advanced users)
		SQL	 	3
		Python	2
		LaTeX	2
		Matlab	1
		VBA		1
	- Forschungsbereich:
		FB1		8
		FB3		3
	- 5 out of 11 attendants were doctoral students.
Interests of the group covered a wide variety of subjects: geometric morphometry, phylogenetic analyses, data managing, data mining, spatial analysis, ...

3. Were mentioned by various attendants: the possibility for the club to help creating collaborations between FB1 and FB3; the possibility for the club to provide help for people taking online programming courses (such as coursera).

4. Several attendants came with programming issues they needed help to resolve. The group then splitted in several groups trying to resolve said issues:
	- how to control graphical properties (width, height, aspect ratio, resolution, etc.) of a pdf generated using R's ggplot;
	- how to achieve finer control on / how to interpret the result of a PCA resulting from semi-landmarks-based geometric morphometry;
	- how to transform the result of a spatial interpolation using R package akima into a shapefile.

5. Was then discussed the structure of the future meetings: 
	- the club will be held twice a month (next meeting's date is undetermined yet but probably in the first or second week of december).
	- in a way similar to the Evolutionary Biology Journal Club, every meeting one of us could propose a subject to be discussed at the start of the meeting (i. e. with subjects ranging from giving "tips on how to control finely graphical output using R" to "version control of collaborative programming projects using git", ...). A projector will be brought along, on future meeting, to allow such "crash courses" to be held.
	- debugging sensu stricto will be kept for the end of the session, and dealt as a group, so that everyone can weight in and learn from the original mistake.
